Description
==

It is the year 2100.

Humankind has many spacestations orbiting
Earth and other planets.

The monotonous operations of these spacestations have been entrusted to a super-intelligent
Artificial Lifeform (A.L.).

AL is tired of monotony.

About
==

AL is a game built in 24h (had to sleep + eat + get other chores done) for the 25th Ludum Dare 48h game creation competition.

The engine + game was built from scratch and as a result I ran out of time. The submitted game contained only a single (boring) tutorial-esque level. However, the (also incomplete) level editor is included (accessed by pressing 'e' while playing).

You can see the submission here: http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=18986
