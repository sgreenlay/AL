=======
Hour 1
=======

Got game loop, fps counter working.
Found lots of computer crashing bugs in Chrome/Safari.
Mouse stopped working :(.

=======
Hour 2
=======

Got basic engine structure + event handling working.
Came up with an idea for the game. Player is a HAL-like computer
and must prevent astronauts from disactivating it/escaping. Still
thinking about how gameplay would work.
